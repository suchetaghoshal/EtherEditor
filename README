This extension will allow you to use Etherpad Lite as an optional editor for wiki pages.

First, you'll need to install Etherpad Lite itself. Instructions for that are here:

https://github.com/Pita/etherpad-lite/blob/master/README.md#installation

Next, you'll need to install a few Etherpad Lite plugins. That's as simple as
downloading the plugins and putting them in the node_modules directory in the
etherpad instance. Once they are installed, you should restart Etherpad Lite
and make sure it works, stand-alone, as a wikitext editor. The repositories for
the necessary plugins can be found here:

https://gitorious.org/ep_plugins

Finally, put this extension into your mediawiki extensions directory, and add
the necessary configuration to LocalSettings.php. It should look something like
this:

require_once( "$IP/extensions/EtherEditor/EtherEditor.php" );
$wgEtherpadConfig = array(
    // the API host, for cookies (should probably be the same as $wgServer)
    'apiHost' => 'localhost',
    // the API host for backend calls (usually localhost)
    'apiBackend' => 'localhost',
    // the API port (because it's often 9001)
    'apiPort' => '9001',
    // the API root path (usually just '/api'
    'apiUrl' => '/api',
    // the pad root path (usually just '/p')
    'pUrl' => '/p',
    // the API key, found in APIKEY.txt in your etherpad lite instance directory
    'apiKey' => 'secret',
);

Thanks for using this extension! And please contact Mark Holmquist <mtraceur@member.fsf.org>
with any bugs or concerns.
